    <p class= "shade">I'm just a guy with a wild imagination, I love horror movies and I write horror stories on Wattpad, I also enjoy playing
    video games in the rpg,adventure and shooter/sci-fi genre. I am very passionate about coding and I hope to gain enough experience to 
    become a game designer. I also want to learn more about how to improve as a coder in order for me to call myself an expert with confidence
    someday. My favorite beverages are red mountain dew, tea, and hot chocolate, I drink water literally all the time, I always have a water bottle 
    next to me and I also sleep next to one. I also don't drink coffee but I do eat the ice cream, (rare occasions) 
    my favorite ice cream is also chocolate and probably cookies and cream(also rare since I would choose chocolate over that any day).
    As for music I don't really have a preference, I listen to anything that sounds good to me,but even if it sounds good, 
    it might not be in my playlist, but I mostly listen to dub/chillstep. In regular life, I'm a quiet person that just keeps to themself and minds
    their own bussiness, however, I will talk if someone talks to me. I also enjoy silence but I will break it if I don't want it to be too quiet 
    for long. (well thats enough about me for now)</p>
